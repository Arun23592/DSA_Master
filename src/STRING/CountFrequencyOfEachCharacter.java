/*
*
* Optimal Solution: Count Character Frequency in Java
Approach
The most efficient solution uses a HashMap<Character, Integer> to count each characterâ€™s frequency in the given string:

Iterate through every character in the string.

For each character c, increment its count in the hash map.

At the end, the map holds each character and its frequency.
*
*
* Time Complexity
O(n): Each of the n characters is visited once, and HashMap operations (get, put) average O(1) time.

Space Complexity
O(k): Where k is the number of unique characters in the string.
* For ASCII/English letters, k is at most 128 or 256 (i.e., bounded and thus O(1) space for fixed character sets).
* For Unicode or arbitrary input, k may scale with n.
*
*Edge Cases to Consider
Empty String: Should return an empty map.

Null input: Decide on exception/handling behavior.

String with special characters, digits, or mixed case: Solution works as written, but requirements may dictate case insensitivity.

Very long strings: Map storage remains efficient for bounded character sets.

Whitespace handling: Depends on requirements (whitespace is counted as is).
