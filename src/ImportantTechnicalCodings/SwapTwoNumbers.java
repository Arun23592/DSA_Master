/*
*
* 1. Using a Temporary Variable (Most common & readable)
* âœ… Time Complexity: O(1)
âœ… Space Complexity: O(1)
âœ… Simple, readable, and safe.
*
*
*  2. Without Temp Variable â€“ Using Arithmetic:
*
* int a = 10;
int b = 20;

a = a + b; // a = 30
b = a - b; // b = 10
a = a - b; // a = 20

*âœ… Time Complexity: O(1)
âœ… Space Complexity: O(1)
âœ… Efficient, but might cause integer overflow if values are very large.
*
*
*
*  3. Without Temp Variable â€“ Using XOR (Bitwise Swap)
*int a = 10;
int b = 20;

a = a ^ b;
b = a ^ b;
a = a ^ b;

* âœ… Time Complexity: O(1)
âœ… Space Complexity: O(1)
âœ… Safe from overflow, but less readable for beginners.
*
*
* âœ… Interview Perspective
ðŸ”¸ Common Follow-up Questions:
Can you swap without using a third variable?

Why might the arithmetic method fail in some cases?

What is the advantage of using XOR?

How would you swap two values in a list/array?

How would you swap in Java without using primitive types (e.g., using wrapper classes or objects)
*
*
* âœ… Best Practice (for interviews):
Start with the temp variable method for readability.

Then mention the other two methods and their trade-offs.

Prefer XOR when interviewer asks about optimized or clever solutions.
